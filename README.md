# Recipe-Database

Making a recipe database with a GUI app and random recipe selector.

First thing I am going to do is figure out how I am going to store the recipie information. I think that I want to use SQLite.

I created the data structure that I am going to go with.

I am going to start out making it as a command line application. Then later will make it into a full gui app.
