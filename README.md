# Recipe-Database

Making a recipe database with a GUI app and random recipe selector.

First thing I am going to do is figure out how I am going to store the recipie information. I think that I want to use SQLite.

I created the data structure that I am going to go with.

I am going to start out making it as a command line application. Then later will make it into a full gui app.

I have made the add recipe function now but I have not tested it just yet. It \*should work but I want to test it with my wife.

Testing has gone well other than I still need to figure out how to use multiple variables in an SQL statement.

## New and Better

I am not going to do the sql database right now since it really is not needed for this application I believe. Instead I am going to use python dictionaries and lists. They are blazing fast and mutable which is wonderful and they are pretty dang easy to get set up and going.

I am using primarily dictionaries because they are super fast and memory efficient

I am saving all of the information in json files. It is very easy and works really well after I actually write it correctly.

It is almost at a point to where we can start using it. I do want to get the search feature figured out because it is key.
